            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Innumerable are the abſurdities, and ridiculous are the extravagancies which the Spirit of perſecution, the exerciſing dominion over the conſciences of others, leads men into; we may have ſeene the proofe thereof not long ſince amongſt our ſelves.</p>
            <p>The firſt and loudeſt cry of our Reformers was againſt a Common-Prayer-Booke, Printed Homelies, and cuſtomary or curtal'd Pulpit prayers, all of them as Antichriſtian and abominable; but againſt Biſhops as yet more abominable, not only for approving, but enjoyning them: would any thinke then that theſe very Reformers, even before they can be certaine how farre their endeavours ſhall bee approved throughout the Kingdome, much leſſe confirmed, ſhould have the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to goe about or make ſhew of an intention to erect a greater Idoll of the ſelfe ſame Fabricke, their owne imagination? and yet upon indifferent and due enquiry it may be found ſo; for whereas they have heretofore ſo much exclamed againſt Epiſcopacie for ſtinting of the Spirit, in ſome part or particulars only of Gods worſhip; they now thinking themſelves ſufficiently qualified, being to take upon them to eſtabliſh a Dagon on his throne in ſtinting the whole worſhip of the Great God of Heaven, in manacling the conſciences of his Saints their brethren, and not ſuffering them to pay their very tythings, or perform the leaſt parcell of their duty unto the only Creator of the world, ſave in ſuch manner as they allow of, and impoſe upon them: <hi>Stand amazed oh Heaven and Earth; judge, but in mercy,

not making the Goſpell chargeable to the Corinthians, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.15.18. On how ought they to tremble who have gone point blanck againſt the evidence of ſuch a truth? Beſides, may we not juſtly feare theſe Popiſh badges, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining ſtill in Gods juſt judgement, may prove a ſoveraigne bait and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to intice thoſe ſlow bellies to us againe, who firſt eſtabliſhed them? But is it not moſt evident, that throughout the whole Goſpel there is not one word found to countenance a forcing of the people to contribute unto the poore, or to the miniſtry any thing, but what they pleaſe themſelves? if tithes or ſuch like maintenance were due now under the Goſpel by virtue of the Moſaicall Law, doubtleſſe our Saviour and his Apoſtles would have ſignified ſo much. 'Tis true, that certaine paſſages of theirs are miſtaken by ſome, as if they ſeemed to glance thereat, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.13. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.18. but that was only ſo farre forth as wee are ſtill bound by the equity thereof in <hi>fore conſcientia,</hi> not to the literall obſervance <hi>in foro fori,</hi> as no wayes ſuiting with thoſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall expreſſions of <hi>Pauls,</hi> in urging it onely as voluntary in thoſe which were to give it, and his owne practice in not requiring it as a legall duty: for his owne behoofe, and inſtructing others to doe the ſame, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.17.18. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, if it were legally due, why did not <hi>Paul</hi> compell them to the payment of it? Did he want meanes or power ſo to doe? Surely ſuch as have the gift of miracles cannot be ſaid to want helpe to right themſelves, and vindicate Gods portion? and we may ſee <hi>Act.</hi> 5. in the beginning, that <hi>Peter</hi> knew full well his owne ſtrength, and made uſe of it in ſuch a caſe; when <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> having put themſelves into the number of the Diſciples, to ſhow they did, at leaſt, deſire to ſeeme like the reſt, ſold a poſſeſſion, and made as if they had laid the whole value thereof at the Apoſtles feet, but ſecretly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held part thereof; for which groſſe hypocriſie <hi>Peter</hi> puniſhed them no leſſe miraculouſly than ſeverely with death, ſaying, <hi>Whilſt it remained was it not thine owne? and after it was ſold, was it not in thine owne power? why haſt thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this thing in thine heart? thou haſt not lyed unto men, but unto the holy Ghoſt, Act.</hi> 5.4. From whence we may gather a cleare argument, that they were not forced to any allowance of Tythes, or ought elſe in ſtead thereof, for had there beene any ſuch like duty due to God in his Miniſtes according to the Letter, (I ſay not according to the equity thereof) it was as much due be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the poſſeſſion was ſold, before it was laid downe at the Apoſtles feet devoted to the ſervice of the Saints, as it was afterwards; the civill proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters conſent gaines neither unto God nor to his Saints under the Goſpel ever a whit the better title to any earthly goods in reſpect of the right or thing it ſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in reſpect to the manner of receiving it in a legall compulſive civill way, if the intereſſed having once given conſent, may afterwards continue

(but refuſe) paiment of it without defilement to their conſciences. <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> were not ſtruck dead for denying alines unto the poore Saints, or maintenance unto the miniſtry; but becauſe they played the hypocrites ſo groſſely, ſeeking to bee thought more liberall than their covetous deſires would give them leave: And yet we may not thinke that denying almes and maintenance were a leſſer ſin than hypocriſie; or that hypocrites may now be puniſhed with death by Civill Magiſtrates: but as in the yeelding of ſuch maintenance and almes there muſt be ſo much ſpirituall, and conſequently voluntary as made them acceptable unto <hi>God;</hi> ſo will <hi>God</hi> himſelfe have the puniſhing of the non-performance, becauſe man cannot poſſibly be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judge thereof: and hypocriſie in like manner being not diſcernable by man, and the puniſhment of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> miraculous; none can poſſibly, much leſſe may juſtly claime to doe the ſame, unleſſe they have the ſame power of miracles and diſcerning.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Peters</hi> profeſſing that what <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> did poſſeſſe was their owne, as afore; and our Saviour in the Parable, <hi>Math.</hi> 20.15. makes it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for us to doe what we will with our owne; I query by what Law wee can be compelled to part from that we have without our owne conſents? If <hi>Tythes,</hi> or whatſoever like them, be either <hi>Gods</hi> or <hi>Caeſars,</hi> I know a warrant for them: but as <hi>Caeſars Image</hi> entitled him to the tribute money, <hi>Math.</hi> 22.19. ſo doth <hi>God</hi> chiefly aime at the <hi>tribute of our conſciences,</hi> on which he ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped his owne image and likeneſſe in our father <hi>Adam</hi> at his creation <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26. But if the Tythes be the Miniſters, why doe we ſtill commit ſacriledge, withholding them in ſo many places of the Kingdome? Doe we not feare what befell <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> if ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And whereas it is alledged, that if they which attend upon the miniſtery muſt be bound to live on ſuch almes onely as ſhall be voluntarily given them; it may likely prove a great temptation to frame their doctrine according to the peoples ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

forced to make payment thereof; it muſt be Tithes preciſely; the tenth of all what ever we poſſeſſe; for we find not ſo much as a ſhadow in Scripture for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other warrant: &amp; according to this proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, either the tenth man ſhould be a Miniſter of the Goſpel, or elſe the Miniſters being never ſo few, &amp; the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer the better cheer, ſharing among themſelves the tenth part of the revenues of all the Kingdom or Chriſtian world, each of them would have a yearly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come larger than that of Canterburies: ſurely this is ſuch a temptation, that if ſuch as expect the ſweetneſſe of it may be judge thereof, as doubtleſſe they will never more away with Biſhops; ſo they will as certainly bee deſirous, and no wayes be prevailed upon, till God turne their hearts, not to enjoy ſuch large eſtates, which through pretence of enabling them to become hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and attend upon their miniſterie, will as infallibly make them degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into drones and dumb Teachers as ever were Biſhops of any Country.</p>
                  <p>But if perhaps they ſhould be ſo modeſt for the preſent as to ſay they bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aime at maintenance; 200. or 300. pounds <hi>per annum</hi> ſhall bee the height of their ambition, &amp;c.

I anſwer, that for ſuch as are not ſpiritually minded, 200. or 300. pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> and a farre leſſe revenue certaine, is as great a temptation to thoſe whoſe anceſtors perhaps were never worth the tithes thereof; I ſay it is as great a temptation and altogether as ſufficient to make ſuch intrude into the Miniſterie for love of the maintenance, as a more corpulent fat Biſhopricke: it is the lazie but conſtant Benefice which for the moſt part doth firſt corrupt their younger thoughts and actions: from whence according to the ſame depraved prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples they afterwards aſpire unto a Biſhopricke, which perhaps their more inferiour aimes did never thinke upon before.

                  <p>IF our Saviour will not breake a bruſed reed; what thinke we of they that make a profeſſion of tormenting the broken hearted, and uſe violence to tender conſciences? If Chriſt whileſt he was on earth preaching of his owne Goſpel declares that he was not to judge ſuch as did not beleeve it; what is man that he dares torment and judge the people <hi>before the time, Matth.</hi> 8.29. If Gods word muſt doe it, and that in the laſt day; whence are theſe Conſiſtories, Inquiſition houſes, High Commiſſion Courts, with all their humane Ordinances and Canons which anticipate or antidate Gods judgements? Who art then O man that judgeſt another whom God that is able to make him ſtand will hold up? <hi>Rom</hi> 14.4. as if he ſhould ſay, ſome are ſo prejudged who yet ſhall ſtand, as if ſet up on purpoſe to ſhew
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:111953:21"/>
the depth of Gods power and counſells in condemning the raſhneſſe of ſuch other forward judgements.</p>
                  <p>Our Saviour told his Diſciples, ſaying, <hi>As my Father hath ſent me ſo ſend I you, Joh.</hi> 20.21. and if you will heare how he was ſent, he ſayes of himſelfe, <hi>I am not ſent ſave to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael, Matth.</hi> 15.24. <hi>And I came not to call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance, Mark.</hi> 2.17. <hi>The Son of man is not come to deſtroy mens lives, but to ſave them, Luke</hi> 9.56. He hath ſent me to <hi>heale the broken hearted, C.</hi> 4.18. And according here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto we finde ſo many ſweet qualifications of a Biſhop recommended by <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> which had they beene well reflected on in our choice of Miniſters, we ſhould not have had ſo many pious people driven out of the Country: they ought not to be ſoone angry, no ſtrikers, gentle, apt to teach, patient, meek, inſtructing even thoſe that doe oppoſe, each where of is ſo oppoſite to perſecution, and all ſo ſweetly ſympathiſing and combining, as were they found in Miniſters, being according to Gods avouched Ordinance, they could not chooſe but miraculouſly conduce to the propagation of the Goſpel: It ſayes indefinitely, they muſt inſtruct ſuch as oppoſe: how dare we then give over inſtructing ſo long as they are willing to heare it? nay they muſt yet goe ſomewhat further, <hi>in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and out of ſeaſon,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. and with ſuch long ſuffering as may recover <hi>Paul</hi> from the <hi>fire</hi> of perſecuting others, <hi>Jude</hi> 23. and receive a <hi>good theefe from the croſſe, Luke</hi> 23.43. But how neceſſary and conſiderable this meekneſſe is for inſtructing all oppoſers, we may clearly learne by way of a ſimilitude, from ſuch as have ſeen how little execution the fierceſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non ſhot point blanke, can doe againſt mud-walls or wool-ſacks.</p>
                  <p>And ſince, beſides the ſpotleſſe example of our Saviour, we finde the Apoſtles were contented to keepe themſelves to the fooliſhneſſe of the Goſpel, and only ſhake the duſt from off their feet againſt ſuch as rejected the Goſpel: ſhall we be excuſable that undervalue and ſlight the ſimplicity of <hi>Gods Ordinances?</hi> will we be wiſer than God himſelfe? or have wee a ſtock of ſuperogation to returne unto God more then we owe him, or he requireth of us? But to argue with ſuch in the ſphere of Politicks where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they thinke themſelves ſo active: is it not the higheſt indiſcretion to make our ſelves more worke then needs? and has not God continually declared himſelfe, that obedience is better than ſacrifice, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.22.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Eliſha</hi> had bid <hi>Naaman</hi> waſh himſelfe ſeven times in the River Jordan, and his fleſh ſhould returne whole again, <hi>Naaman</hi> thinking this an unlikely way becauſe eaſie, forbore to make triall of it untill his ſervants ſaid, What if the Prophet had bid thee doe ſome great thing, wouldeſt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:111953:22"/>
thou not have done it? how much rather when he ſaith only, <hi>Waſh and be cleane?</hi> 2 King. 5.10,11,12,13. May not God in like manner juſtly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, and even with much juſtice confound theſe hotſpurs of Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who when our <hi>Saviour</hi> orders them only to <hi>exhort with long ſuffering, reprove, rebuke, and ſhake off the duſt</hi> as a witnes againſt ſuch as will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Goſpel; decline theſe wayes of <hi>God,</hi> and betake themſelves to their own inventions of impriſoning, fining, baniſhing, and putting to death? will not <hi>God</hi> ſay, <hi>who hath required theſe things at your hands?</hi> Eſa. 1.12. and becauſe they have not been faithfull in a little, caſt them with the unprofitable ſervant into utter darknes? <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.30.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Paul</hi> had provoked the Jewes to imbrace the Goſpel by all faire meanes, and they reſiſted it; he conceived his Commiſſion and truſt was diſcharged, taking himſelfe to be cleere from their blood, <hi>Act.</hi> 18.6. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we thinke nothing will cleere us in ſuch caſes, unleſſe we ſhed their blood: for though a miraculous power wore ceaſed, (which I nothing doubt whether it be otherwiſe ceaſed than on our part, through want of faith in us to exerciſe it) yet this is not ground ſufficient for us to flie unto the Civill power; there muſt be both a lawfull calling to it, and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe warrant towards whom to uſe it.</p>
                  <p>I know the Propheſie of <hi>Eſaiah</hi> is much ſtood upon, that <hi>Kings and Queenes ſhall be nurſing Fathers and nurſing mothers unto the Church,</hi> Iſa. 49.23. but the meaning thereof is; by ſubjecting themſelves to the Churches Spirituall Power, not by giving power to any to ſuppreſſe the viſible Church, as appeareth by the context: it is by granting the Church a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of profeſſion, not by impoſing on them a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

In the 10. of <hi>John,</hi> our bleſſed Saviour gives us many properties both of good and bad Shepherds, ſaying of himſelfe, <hi>I am the good Shepherd,</hi> and <hi>the good Shepherd layeth down his life for his ſheep,</hi> ver. 1 1. Now if we doe but take a little notice of this ſupereminent character of a good Shepherd in <hi>laying down his life;</hi> we cannot chuſe but ſee the Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuter muſt neceſſarily be the worſt of Shepheards, and principally contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinguiſhed from the beſt, in this; that <hi>he takes away the lives of his ſheepe:</hi> Had this caſe been brought before the wiſe King <hi>Salomon,</hi> he would as certainly have declared ſuch perſecuters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who continually perplex and hunt the ſheep, to be <hi>hirelings,</hi> and no <hi>true ſhepherds,</hi> as he did that woman to be the feigned mother, who cryed out for dividing of the child, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 3.25.26.27.</p>

Thus are all Chriſtians call'd upon to be courteous, gentle, meeke, long ſuffering, ready to give a reaſon to every one that asks, and all other good works which may make their <hi>converſation acceptable and winning:</hi> But how it ſhould be poſſible for the converſation of Perſecuters to become plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, or leſſe than hatefull, and driving men from God, will oppoſe that arch enemy of mankind to make appeare for juſtifying of his inſtruments at the dreadfull day of judgement; when amongſt other hideous ſtories, ſhall be ripped up, full many not unlike to that which is reported of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Americans, who (amongſt millions) being condemned to death by perſecuting Spaniards, and preſſed upon by the ſilly Popiſh Prieſts, that they would ſuddenly bethinke themſelves now they were in the midſt of ſlames ready to expire the laſt, and leave this world; asked where the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards went after death, that they might deſire to goe rather any where elſe then thither.</p>
                  <p>Now as this is no good way of preaching, much leſſe of winning all Nations; ſo it is granted by all Chriſtians, that the Jewes in their poſterity ſhall infallibly be converted unto the acknowledgement of the Goſpel: but if all the world elſe had been Chriſtian, and all Chriſtians held for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting of them, the whole Nation muſt have been long ſince cut off by the Magiſtrates ſword for blaſpheming of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and thereby have falſified ſo many cleere Prophecies throughout the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Goſpel</hi> for their converſion. This is ſo evident, that the Pope himſelfe, the Grand Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor, throughout his Civill Dominions both in <hi>Italie</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> permits the Jewes to live and enjoy exact proprie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:111953:23"/>
them put to death, but rather live; that Chriſtians cut out of the wild Olive tree by nature, and grafted into the good, by this hard-heartednes of theirs might take example, and be ſo much more watchfull of continuing in Gods goodnes, leſt He alſo cut them off againe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.22.24. ſo that as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.12. if <hi>the fulneſſe of the Jewes be the riches of the world; and the diminiſhing of them the rickes of the Gentiles:</hi> how much more the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them ſtill to live a continuall warning-piece and remembrancer whilſt they perſiſt in obſtinacie? and how moſt of all will their fulnes at converſion be a greater cauſe of joy unto the Gentiles, and as it were another <hi>life from death,</hi> ver. 15. If theſe and ſuch other reaſons as are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged, will not prevaile to ſuffer them and other <hi>tares</hi> untill the <hi>harveſt;</hi> we had need ſeeke out ſome other warrant than any extant in our Bibles; or find ſome better gloſſe to excuſe us at the day of tryall, than any which hither to have been produced.</p>
                  <p>And ſince <hi>Paul</hi> foretold us that the converſion of the <hi>Jewes</hi> will be ſuch joy and riches unto the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Rom. 11.12.15. I humbly crave leave to propound it as a Querie which may juſtly inject no little ſcruple into the mindes of Chriſtian States; Whether all the Gentiles ſhall fare well alike in the Jewes returning; or ſuch only, and they proportionably, to what they have contributed thereunto, by permitting them to live amongſt them, and furthering their converſion by a godly converſation, with all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meanes preſcribed by our Saviour and his Apoſtles for alluring them unto the Goſpel?</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41. we find it ſaid, That <hi>they which gladly received the Word. were baptized:</hi> and according unto that example it will follow, that ſuch as doe not gladly receive it, ſhould not be baptized, much leſſe enjoyned to come and participate in the Communion of the body and blood of Chriſt (according to certain orders in that behalfe) whether they be fit or willing: this is to offer violence unto the ſoules of ſuch, and no better than forcing doggs and ſwine to eat the childrens bread againſt their ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks, rather than they will be beaten for refuſing.</p>
                  <p>But with what appearance of reaſon can it be imagined that ſince our Saviour gave unto his Church a liberty to uſe miraculous power, he did not alſo order them upon juſt occaſion to uſe the Civill power, if ſuch had been his pleaſure? as meere men they might likelier prevaile with men, in whoſe hands the Civill Power was, for their aſſiſtance; and God was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to give them power over both alike: had it been Gods will, the means for executing Civill Power, muſt have been as ſubject to them as was that of miracles: But ſince he was totally ſilent concerning their imploying
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:111953:23"/>
of the Civill power; it is an undeniable argument that God never meant they ſhould uſurpe it.</p>
                  <p>Since then Chriſt is the <hi>God of Peace,</hi> Rom. 16.20. nay he is our <hi>Peace it ſelfe,</hi> Epheſ. 2.14. He came not to ſend ſword or war, otherwiſe then he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies: and the like woe betides them that bring whether hereſies or wars. <hi>Chriſt brought us Peace,</hi> Luc. 2.14. and <hi>his Word is the Goſpel of Peace,</hi> Rom. 10.15. <hi>God hath called us unto Peace,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.15. We are commanded to <hi>follow after the things which make for peace,</hi> Rom. 14.19. and that <hi>if it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, we ſhould live peaceably with all men,</hi> Rom. 12.18. Having ſeen and heard of the firings of ſo many famous Cities, the devaſtation of ſo many ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and fruitfull Countries, the raviſhing of ſo many Virgins, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation of ſo much Chriſtian blood; let us at laſt in the feare of God, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to be the ſonnes of Peace, <hi>beati pacifici,</hi> the bleſſed peace-makers, in full aſſurance that it doth no where appeare that God ever ſanctified the Sword to cut out a paſſage for the Goſpel; nor that it was ever propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by War, otherwiſe then in judgement to them that diſturbed the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings thereof in Peace.</p>
                  <p>We find our Saviour and his Apoſtles did firſt inſtruct the Jewes in the duties and myſteries of the Goſpel, before they declared voyd the duties of the Law, or exhorted them to ſuſpend obſervance thereunto: nay we ſee expreſly that they permitted them to conforme unto many Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Law, even after the Goſpel had been tendred to them ſome yeares together, <hi>Act.</hi> 21. <hi>v.</hi> 22. &amp; 27. for <hi>Paul</hi> was above 3 yeares after his converſion, before he went to Jeruſalem, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.18. at which time the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> and the Elders of Jeruſalem adviſed <hi>Paul,</hi> and he accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly conformed himſelfe to certaine Jewiſh Ceremonies, to take away offence from the weaker brethren of the Jewes, as in that place of <hi>Acts</hi> above quoted: and even afterwards when both they and the Gentiles had had a copetent time to be throughly informed in, yet not being convinced by reaſon, nor by the Word, they left them to be won unto the Goſpel by the peaceable and blameleſſe converſation and example of ſuch as did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.12. &amp; 3.1. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4 12. and could it rationally be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe? can we raiſe a new building more ſtrong, handſome or commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in any place, without pulling down the old, and carrying away the rubbiſh? or without rectifying alſo and repairing the very foundation it ſelfe, if need require? for want of which due proceeding, and liberty to exerciſe it freely, it may have been obſerved, that great Reformations for the moſt part in <hi>Germany, Netherlands, Scotland, England,</hi> and other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, have been brought about in a tumultuous and diſorderly way, not
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:111953:24"/>
without great diſhonour to God, offence and ſcandall unto his deereſt ſervants: and it may likewiſe as eaſily appeare, that God ſo permitted it in judgement to thoſe States and Princes, who through perſecution of his Saints that witneſſed againſt the errors and ſuperſtitions of the times, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied entring and admittance unto the Truth in Peace.</p>
                  <p>Such as derive their Calling and Commiſſion from our <hi>Saviour,</hi> may not be governed in the execution thereof by any other order or direction than what He himſelfe gave them; much leſſe by ſuch as are repugnant or inconſiſtent with our <hi>Saviours.</hi> Now we are ſo far from finding in the New Teſtament any warrant for uſing of <hi>coercive power,</hi> that if we read from one end unto the other, it will appeare that neither our <hi>Saviour</hi> nor his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did ſo much as lay any of their commands o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="1">(1) <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt was ſent into the world as a forerunner to exhort the people unto repentance; to exalt the valleyes, and make low e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very hill and mountaine, to make ſtreight the crooked places, and plaine all ſuch as are rough, <hi>Eſ.</hi> 43.4. to turne the hearts of the fathers unto the children, and the diſobedient to the wiſdome of the juſt, to make ready the people, and prepare them to receive the Lord Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.1.2. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.17. And as this was ordained from eternity by the infinite wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Almighty; ſo is a freedome and liberty of Conſcience abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary for the further propagation of the Goſpell, as well in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of thoſe that never yet heard thereof, as of ſuch who are but chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and weake in faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of all others which are at preſent, or ſhall be at any time hereafter erroniouſly inſtructed, for illuminating their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, and rectifying their judgements.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) In this ſenſe it is that we muſt neither call, nor be called Rabbi, maſter or father, no relations muſt cauſe us to ſweare <hi>in verba Magiſtri,</hi> contrary to our owne conſcience: 'twas the Lord of life who with the price of his owne blood redeemed us from death, and purchaſed for us freedome not to be ſubject unto men, further then we can concurre with our owne conſciences and judgements; but Chriſt is Lord Paramount, and him we muſt with faithfull <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeve and obey, even <hi>againſt hope,</hi> and in ſome ſenſe againſt our owne reaſon, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.18. for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and devotion, muſt our conſcience be reſerved chaſte, and undefiled, to his Scepter only muſt that yeeld, it cannot ſerve Chriſt and Mammon, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.24. He will ſhare ſtakes with no creature; <hi>all, or none for him.</hi> Oh! how jealous ſhould we then be of endeavouring to conduct this Virgin immaculate and untainted through the pollutions of this ſeducing world, unto her Bridegroome in heaven? Had it not been for that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed liberty of Printing which this Kingdome has enjoyed ſome two or three yeares together after the firſt ſitting of this Parliament, we had yet remained in ignorance of much ſaving truth, and amongſt other miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes beene ſtill as deeply engaged for Epiſcopacie, as ever; but ſince God thereby has already given ſo great a bleſſing to us, as an earneſt of his greater bounty hereafter, why doe we ſtifle it in the birth? ſuch as perceive the uſurpation of Epiſcopacie, are not yet ſatisfied that Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery has a better title; or, that if Biſhops may not rule over us <hi>without our owne conſents,</hi> why Presbyters ſhould doe the ſame <hi>againſt conſent:</hi> If ſuch a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:111953:26"/>
Presbytery be Goſpel proofe, why is it afraid to come to triall? Let men and Angels ſpeake freely what they can both for it and againſt it; elſe, how ſhall we be able to diſtinguiſh, when to <hi>bleſſe the feet of them that bring glad tidings of good things?</hi> Rom. 10.15. or <hi>curſe ſuch as preach other doctrine?</hi> Gal 1.8. And if you ſay that through this freedome twenty damnable errours have been ſpread for every ſaving truth: I anſwer, that theſe errours, hereſies and <hi>offences muſt needs have come,</hi> if we may beleeve the Bleſſed Spirit, <hi>that they which are approved might be made manifeſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.19. neither are you further acceſſory to their comming, than in not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining them by a coercive power, which Chriſt or his Apoſtles, not only never gave you warrant for, but have at leaſt clearly inſinuated (if you ſhould not yet ſee an expreſſe commanding of) the contrary; and the <hi>woe</hi> is pronounced on them <hi>by whom they come,</hi> Matth. 18.17. not on thoſe that could not keep them out by other meanes than ſuch as were unjuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable, and muſt at ſame time have with-held the truth, 2 Cor. 8.12. If <hi>ſuch as participate of the body and bloud of Chriſt unworthily receive to themſelves damnation,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.29. If preaching <hi>the word of God be a ſavour of death unto death to ſuch as periſh,</hi> 1 Cor. 2 15,16. What wonder is it then, that, if a Chriſtian or Civill liberty in matters of conſcience only be granted; <hi>ſuch as were never of us, ſhould goe out from us?</hi> when the Spirit of God ſayes, <hi>they went out from us</hi> for this very reaſon, <hi>that we might know they were not of us,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.19. and <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, <hi>there ſhould ariſe falſe prophets tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching damnable hereſies,</hi> and <hi>denying even the Lord that bought them,</hi> bringing upon themſelves damnation, and that <hi>many ſhall follow their pernitious waies by reaſon of whom the truth ſhall be evill ſpoken of;</hi> but (marke what he ſaies) that notwithſtanding all this, <hi>the Lord knoweth how to deliver the Godly out of temptations, and reſerve the unjuſt to be puniſhed at the day of judgement,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.1.2.9. What if God who was willing to ſhew his wrath, and make his power knowne, enduring with much long ſuffering the veſſells of wrath fitted to deſtruction, ſhall ſay <hi>there muſt be offences? Hath not the potter power over the clay to make veſſells of diſhonour alſo?</hi> Rom 9.21,22. will we be wiſer then God Himſelfe? Gods will and commandement as it was to <hi>Abraham</hi> for ſacrificing <hi>Iſaac, Gen.</hi> 22.23. ſhould be reaſon enough to require and finde obedience from all good Chriſtians; and yet the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ſuffering erroneous opinions to be publiſhed, leſt truth thereby ſhould be ſtifled, is ſo cleare and neceſſary to the eye of reaſon, as it is for him that hath loſt any thing, to ſeek it where it is not, as well as where it is, if ever he mean to finde it; but you will ſay you have not loſt truth, and perhaps you have not; perhaps you never had it to loſe; you make men
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:111953:26"/>
jealous thereof in that you are ſo loth to ſhew it by your workes, <hi>James</hi> 2.18. ſo backward in giving a reaſon and account thereof in bringing it to the touchſtone, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. But moſt certaine it is, you have not the whole truth <hi>according to the meaſure and ſtature of Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 4.13. you have not the fulneſſe of perfection <hi>to be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect,</hi> Mat. 5.48. If you doe but thinke ſo, 'tis a certaine ſigne you are not ſo; and becauſe you come ſhort thereof and <hi>know but in part,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.9. for the love of that which is ſtill wanting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you muſt make ſearch and enquiry even where it is not to be found: Our Saviour ſayes, <hi>Seeke and you ſhall finde,</hi> Matth. 7.7. but it would be an improper ſpeech to ſay ſeeke, if we could goe readily where it were; and what need we examine that we learne, if we could be ſure it were the truth without examining? or what profiteth it to have found out the truth, if we have not liberty to embrace it, and make profeſſion of it? But as the Law entred, that the offence might abound, and where ſin abounded, grace did much more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20 21. ſo muſt erroneous doctrines be permitted that the truth may ſhine more glorious; ſo muſt you not ſuppreſſe ſuch, unleſſe you will at ſame time runne hazard to ſuppreſſe the truth: what then? muſt we ſinne that grace may abound? <hi>Rom.</hi> 6 1. muſt we cheriſh hereticks for exerciſing the patience of true beleevers? or that when they get ſtrength enough they may perſecute them to death?

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:111953:27"/>
thereunto, if the Church of <hi>England</hi> did not impoſe it on them, and require obedience from them: The like may be ſaid concerning moſt of the differences betwixt Proteſtants and Papiſts; as the Papiſts denying marriage to the Clergy, the cup in the Euchariſt unto the Laity, their vowes for poverty and ſingle life, neither of them neceſſary in themſelves, and all diſpenſable by the Pope; nay, the moſt learned and moderate Papiſts generally, cannot only chooſe but grant through ſtrength and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of reaſon, that men may goe to Heaven and not trouble their thoughts with Purgatory, that great <hi>Dianah</hi> and Craftſmiſtris which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigles and nouriſhes them all up in idleneſſe and ignorance; but their very principles conclude it: for ſince they hold it in their power to doe what good they will, even to works of ſupererogation; it followes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably from the ſame ground, that they can work out their own ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with much more eaſe then a Journyman doth his daily taske, and may poſſibly have no need to pray to God for any thing in all their life time, or ſtand in need of a Jeſus to be their Saviour or Mediator, much leſſe of a phantaſticall Purgatory to purifie them a little, before they can get ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance into heaven: and for their grand ſtumbling blocke of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, what underſtanding and conſiderate Papiſt almoſt will deny, but that a Chriſtian may poſſibly be a worthy receiver, who ſhall notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding acknowledge before hand that he findes not evidence enough in thoſe words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.26. <hi>This is my body,</hi> to convince him of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, but in regard it is ſo farre controverted on either ſide, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines neither in his owne thoughts, but humbly ſubmits himſelfe to apply them implicitely in ſuch a ſenſe and meaning, as our Saviour underſtood thereby, when he uttered them to his Apoſtles: ſo that both with Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants and Papiſts it is the Churches and States determining and impoſing them on others, that makes many points neceſſary to ſalvation, which of themſelves were but indifferent.</p>
                  <p>And whereas it is objected that in matters indifferent, Chriſtian liberty giving us leave, either to conforme, or not conforme; we are moved to conforme thereto, becauſe many would be offended in our non-conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: I anſwer that as there are many offended through <hi>non-conformity;</hi> ſo on the other ſide many are ſcandalized by ſuch <hi>conformity;</hi> and ſince there is offence on either ſide, it will not ſuffice to ſhuffle off the buſineſſe by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing that ſuch <hi>conformity</hi> is cauſe only of an <hi>offence taken,</hi> but <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity</hi> would juſtly give <hi>offence;</hi> for beſides that this diſtinction for the moſt part is applied contrarily to what it ſhould, it availes no whit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a reconciliation: But ſecondly, I ſay, ſuch as are offended in this
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:111953:27"/>
                     <hi>non-conformity,</hi> hold the things of themſelves indifferent unto which <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity</hi> is required; and ſo may eaſily, diſpenſing with what they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend to have no obligation to, be reconciled; but ſuch as are offended at <hi>conformity,</hi> hold the points in controverſie (how ſlightly ſoever eſteemed by others) abominable, damnable in the ſight of God; and ſince the one cannot ſubmit upon perill of imminent <hi>damnation, Rom.</hi> 14.23. the other is bound to yeeld, that we may all arive to a <hi>unity in Chriſt, Eph</hi> 4 13. and according to <hi>Pauls</hi> rule, <hi>that no man ſeeke his owne, but every man anothers wealth;</hi> to <hi>pleaſe all men in all things, not ſeeking our owne profit, but the profit of many that they may be ſaved,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.24 33.</p>
                  <p>But if you will ſay, though ſuch things were indifferent in themſelves at firſt, yet being once impoſed either by Proteſtant or Popiſh Churches, they doe afterwards become neceſſary, as well through certaine oathes which the people may have taken to be conformable; as alſo in being commanded in Scripture to obey the Powers: I anſwer, that a bad oath is better broke then kept; and ſuch an oath muſt needs be bad, which not only abridges us our Chriſtian Liberty, but hindring us from ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to a <hi>unity in faith,</hi> engages us ſtill further to offend the weaker bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren by our conformity which might have beene forborne as no wayes neceſſary, but abſolutely in it ſelfe indifferent before the taking of ſuch oaths; and ſince God commands us not to offend our weake brother 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.7. &amp;c. C.10.23. &amp;c. and the reſpective States or Churches (which are but men) command conformity unto their Canons which puts us in a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of giving ſuch offence unto our brethren: I refer all good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to what the Apoſtles ſaid in ſuch a caſe, viz. <hi>Whether it be right in the ſight of God to hearken unto you more then unto God, judge ye,</hi> Act. 4.19.</p>
                  <p>And whereas it may be ſaid, that though we were not engaged by oath, yet we ought to obey ſuch Canons or injunctions, in that we are required to be <hi>ſubject to the Powers, Rom.</hi> 13.1. &amp;c. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13. &amp;c.

Then poore Popery! why art thou ſpoken evill of? like <hi>Paul</hi> who though he preacht Circumciſion, was perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as if he had taught the Jewes to walke after other cuſtomes then thoſe which <hi>Moſes</hi> learnt them, <hi>Act.</hi> 21.21. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.11. poore Popery! ſurely this is thy beloved doctrine, and very injurious are they who will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the pedegree thereof from thee from Antichriſt: But how truly Canonicall it is both thou thy ſelfe, and all the world may know by this ſhort hiſtory. A merry companion (as the world calls him) or ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feaſt, next to his freſh ſupply of newes, had furniſhed himſelf with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſtrange but ingenious conceited ſatyricall, and for the moſt part ſcurrilous prophane jeſts and ſtories, in ſuch abundance and variety, that upon all occaſion of common diſcourſe, which generally is idle and vaine, he was ſtill able to inſert ſome one or other, with ſuch dexterity and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:111953:30"/>
that thereby he did ingratiate himſelfe into all company, and got many a good morſell <hi>gratis:</hi> Now although theſe ſtories were meerly of his owne invention, and nothing below the degree of ſupernaturall could prove them poſſible: yet having related them ſo often, and being many times of courſe conſtrained to aſſert the truth of them with change of oaths, by degree forgetting they were the fancies of his own fond head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peece, became at laſt to take them ſo far for verities, as if he himſelfe had ſeen them acted, or had relation from ſuch as were eye-witneſſes: Thus if you will take up upon truſt the tenets of Poperty or any erroneous do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine (though at firſt with much reluctancie) complying and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming there unto without a preceding examination, whether they be of God or no, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.1. 'tis juſt with him, through the deluſions of Sathan, and your owne corruptions, to give you up that you may beleeve a lie, as <hi>Paul</hi> told the Theſſalonians, 2 <hi>Theſſ</hi> 2.11.

Faith is the gift of God, thereby we are ſaved through grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.16. ſo that ſuch as teach men to take up a Religion without trying of it, that men if they themſelves will, may beleeve this or that opinion which is taught them of their ſuperiours, or preſcribed by the State, cenſuring all ſuch for reprobates or obſtinate that ſay they cannot; this is no other then the abſolute ground-worke and corner ſtone, whereon the Papiſts ſoly build, and without which they could not poſſibly have ſo long up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held their ſelfe-loved doctrine of merit and ſupererogation. But ſince man by nature is a childe of wrath inclined to fulfill the deſires of the fleſh, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. and meerly of his owne ſtrength incapable of diſcerning the things of the Spirit; have we not juſt cauſe and grounds from reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe cleer Scriptures to thinke, that prayers unto the Father of lights, and Chriſtian-like inſtructions of ſuch as are Spirituall would prove more powerfull to reclaime a ſinner out of his naturall eſtate, or reduce here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks unto the truth, then the bloudy hands of cruell executioners? the ſpirits of the Prophets are ſubject to the Prophets, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.2. and as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a diamond will cut a diamond; ſo nothing but that which is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall can prevaile upon the ſpirit: we ſee that <hi>Paul</hi> tells the Corinthians their faith muſt not be governed nor ſtand in the wiſdome of men 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.5. much leſſe in their dominion and power which may be void of wiſdom.</p>

                  <p>I know there are very many men even of the Epiſcopall party, who approve exceedingly of ſelfe-deniall and meeke ſpirits in all Chriſtians, eſpecially in Miniſters of the Goſpel, conceiving they ought not to ſeeke or imbrace any Church preferment out of carnall expectation to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Rabbi, have the uppermoſt places in all aſſemblies, and rule over their brethren; but meerly deem ſuch ſuperiority to be neceſſary, as if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut it, there could be no government, but all muſt neceſſarily runne head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Independencie, which they account very Anarchie and confuſion it ſelfe, diſpoſing Gods Church of its owne accord to fall a peeces into in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite hereſies and ſchiſmes: for ſatisfaction therefore of ſuch in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, I ſhall need only entreat them to conſider, whether a ſuperiority of power with a coercive execution of it in the Church, for matters meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Religion, doe not render Chriſtians lyable to be compelled into he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, and by this means every particular congregation, becomes not only ſubject unto ſuch hereſies as ſhall ariſe within it ſelfe, but unto all ſuch as any other Church or Congregation which has attained a ſharper ſword then their owne? and though the warrantableneſſe which the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:111953:37"/>
it is his owne Ordinance: But if a man ſhould ſay he is of this or that he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall opinion, where finde we that two witneſſes ſhall condemne him? or that the Magiſtrate can be cleare for paſſing ſentence if the witneſſes were corrupt? or if a man acknowledge that he were of ſuch an opinion, and conceived he were bound to be ſo upon perill of his damnation, &amp; talk to others thereof with their conſent <hi>out of the abundance of his owne heart, Mat.</hi> 12.34. where finde we commiſſion for tormenting of his body for his conſcience ſake, or becauſe he diſcourſed with his neighbour with ſuch harmleſſe words and matter as his owne heart was able to furniſh him withall, as not having power of other mens? Oh! let us be wary of claiming ſuch coercive power, which doth not only tempt, but neceſſarily engage us to the offending of <hi>Chriſts</hi> little ones; otherwiſe, as our Saviour threatned the <hi>Jews</hi> therewith, we muſt inevitably become acceſſory and guilty, not only of all the blood ſhed from righteous <hi>Abel</hi> to <hi>Zacharias</hi> the ſon of <hi>Barachias,</hi> but of all the Saints, which have been or ſhall be martyred from the beginning of the world unto the end, becauſe it was and will be ſtill ſhed by no other principles then what we our ſelves approve of and practiſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.34.35. <hi>Luke</hi> 11.48.</p>

This the bleſſed Spirit from whom <hi>Solomon</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his wiſdome, confirmes, ſaying, <hi>Deſpiſe not thou the chaſtening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him, for whom the Lord loveth he chaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and ſcourgeth every ſon whom he receiveth; if ye endure chaſtening, God dealeth with you as with ſonnes, for what ſonne is he whom the Father chaſteneth not? but if ye be without chaſtiſement whereof all are partakers, then are ye ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards and not ſonnes. Furthermore, we have had fathers of the fleſh which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected us, and we gave them reverence, ſhall we not much rather be in ſubjection to the Father of Spirits and live? for they verily for a few dayes chaſtened us after their owne pleaſure, but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.

afterward it yeeldeth the peaceable fruit of righteouſneſſe, unto them which are exerciſed thereby, Heb.</hi> 12. from <hi>v.</hi> 5. to 11.

                     <hi>Obſervations upon</hi> CHAP. X.</head>
                  <p>TIs very ſtrange that Chriſtians having been ſo ſtudious in multiplying of ſignes and tokens to know the true Church by, ſhould yet reflect ſo little on perſecution, ſince it cannot be ſo viſibly diſtinguiſhed by any other marke or character, if we will but keep cloſe to the Scriptures! Therein finde we expreſſely how the Head of the Church <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> was perſecuted from the manger, his cradle, unto the croſſe; and is it poſſible for the Head to ſuffer thus, and the members of the Body be at eaſe? or that a perſecuting Body can belong to a perſecuted Head? The chiefeſt and hardeſt leſſon which our <hi>Saviour</hi> taught his Diſciples (it appeares ſo by the paines and time he ſpent therein) was to prepare them for ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring perſecution, becauſe that if this bitter morſell did but downe with them, all the reſt would prove manna, milke, and hony: Not to be large in quotation of other Scriptures, I will only ſay that if we turne over the whole Bible, we ſhall finde nothing therein ſo cleare and frequent, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution to be the portion of <hi>Gods</hi> people: But in regard this ſpirit of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting, in ſome degree more or leſſe, is almoſt as defuſive as originall ſinne it ſelfe, though every body pretends to perſecute or puniſh men as evill doets only, and moſt evident it is that malefactors ought, and do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times ſuffer according to their, evill deeds; yet ſtill it is no leſſe appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that <hi>Gods</hi> Church and people are only to be found amongſt the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers and perſecuted; and if all ſufferers we make two parts only, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating from the reſt, all ſuch as ſuffer for conſcience ſake, ſince none are ſo impudent to a affirme, they kill, rob, ſteale, commit a dultery, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heynous offence againſt the Civill lawes, in reverence and honour to <hi>God</hi> Almighty; we ſhall then finde his people amongſt the ſufferers for conſcience ſake: and now, as is uſuall in Sea-faring, the nearer they draw unto a land or channell to meet with greateſt difficulties: ſo doe we want a larger meaſure of <hi>Gods</hi> diſcerning <hi>Spirit</hi> to carry us farther on,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:111953:40"/>
which may <hi>He</hi> pleaſe to grant for his Sonne <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> ſake, that we may yet at laſt diſcover, who they were that firſt perſecuted him in perſon, and in his choſen ones ever ſince: The perſecuted then for conſcience ſake may yet be diſtinguiſhed into thoſe that are perſecuted only; or elſe into ſuch, who both perſecute others and are yet perſecuted themſelves: but is it not ſtrange that any man ſhould be ſo plunged in ignorance, and paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately tranſported, as to make a conſcience of doing that which himſelfe confeſſes to be evill in others? I never yet met with any, who after hee had bethought himſelfe, would ſay in plaine tearmes, that men ought to be perſecuted meerly for conſcience ſake, and yet how few are there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all ſuch as profeſſe Chriſtianity, but are ſeduced to practiſe it through ſophiſticall diſtinctions, and corrupted, though ſpecious princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of a Nationall Church and uniformity taken upon truſt? but ſuch will ſay we perſecute hereticks only, and others perſecute us becauſe we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve and live according to the truth: Oh fond objecters I how long will you be in love with your owne fondneſſe, ſo much diſtaſtefull to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body but your ſelfe? where finde you a warrant that any one may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute for conſcience ſake? or what reaſon can you alledge within the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of man (if any body may be judge beſide your ſelves) why that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion for which you your ſelf are perſecuted, ſhould be more like the truth, then that which you ſo perſecute? but to cleere the point yet further, by <hi>Gods</hi> aſſiſtance, having made it appeare, as you have ſeene, how the Church of <hi>God</hi> muſt needs be found amongſt ſuch as are perſecuted for conſcience ſake, whereof there are but two ſorts; the one of them being both perſecuters and perſecuted in different reſpects; it followes by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable argument, That <hi>ſuch others as are only perſecuted, and totally diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low all perſecuting for matters of Religion, as the greateſt ſtumbling blocke to the propagation of the Goſpel, muſt neceſſarily be the true Church and Body of Chriſt, none elſe having a capacity (without Gods infinite mercy and diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) of being ever hewen out and ſquared as members ſutable to ſuch a Head: Contrariorum eadem eſt ratio:</hi> Since the true Church muſt needs be perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, that muſt needs be a falſe Church which perſecutes the true one; ſo though this falſe Church be perſecuted likewiſe, yet in regard it cannot be both true &amp; falſe, that perſecuted Church muſt needs be the only true one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>which doth not perſecute others: But that the argument may be compleat and full, as in the mouth of two witneſſes; unto this evidence of reaſon, let me adde a Scripture proofe, <hi>viz. We brethren</hi> [true Chriſtians] <hi>as Iſaak was, are the children of promiſe; but as he that was born after the fleſh perſecuted him that was borne after the Spirit, even ſo is it now, Gal.</hi> 4.28,29. yet ſince

Miniſters of the Goſpel, their moſt glorious title being but nurſing fathers and nurſing mothers unto the Church of God, <hi>Eſa</hi> 49.23. and all of us are, or ought to be Miniſters in or for the Goſpel, though one may have a more excellent calling then an other, according as God hath given him more excellent faculties and gifts: But if any Chriſtian goe beyond his calling, beyond his gift, he is blameable, and if the diſturbance be only Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, the cenſure is to be the like; if a breach of peace, the Civill powers ought to redreſſe, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1.2. but for the Magiſtrate to interpoſe in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters meerly Eccleſiaſticall, otherwiſe then Spiritually, and as a Miniſter of the Goſpel, I finde no warrant for it in all the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) This ſtopping of mouthes was not ſilencing as has beene uſed of late, and appeares ſo, in that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> afterwards, <hi>v.</hi> 12.18. having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them to be guilty by the confeſſion of one of <hi>themſelves,</hi> explaines himſelfe, preſcribing them to be puniſhed by a <hi>ſharpe rebuke;</hi> ſo that by ſtopping of their mouthes, can be ſignified nothing elſe but convincing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> them by inſtruction and reproofe in demonſtration of the Spirit, and as the ſame <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>by ſound doctrine,</hi> that their owne fond fancies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing overcome and ſatisfied, might not have further matter to ſuggeſt, or their mouthes words to utter wherewithall to gainſay the truth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3) Here we ſee that <hi>Pauls</hi> adhering ſo much unto traditions, was the cauſe his knowledge could not keep company with his zeal, which in that reſpect ſeduced him to perſecute the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> would not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged zelots of our times (oh, it grieves me to uſe the word zeale or ze<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lot to its leaſt diſparagement or blemiſh!) if they had heard <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, he found himſelfe bound in conſcience to oppoſe the Name of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> and hale his ſervants up and downe the ſtreets from one Magiſtrate unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, at laſt into the priſons, reply, <hi>Paul</hi> thou lieſt; thou art wilfully ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious and reprobately obſtinate: Oh! let them bring it home unto their owne hearts, and conſider whether many poore Brethren, who never flew ſo high as <hi>Pauls</hi> extravagancies, but only differ from them in ſome few opinions, (which yet like enough will agree together in Heaven) may not be interpreted to continue in them meerly out of conſcience: and whether if <hi>Paul</hi> a veſſell of election ſo fiercely perſecuted the <hi>Saints</hi> of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> they themſelves ſo much inferiour gifted in compariſon of <hi>Paul,</hi> may not have been ſubject to the ſame temptation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. and plunged into the ſelfe ſame errour?

reſembleth one gone aſtray that hath loſt himſelfe in ſome by-paths, who the longer or the faſter that he goeth, is ſtill more out of his way, and has the farther to returne againe; and yet I dare not ſay that it is better to have no zeale, then to be in ſome ſmaller meaſure zealous in a bad cauſe; for he that hath no zeale at all, can never have it in a good cauſe; and perhaps it may be obſerved, that ſuch as have none, are at beſt but luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warme <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> Which <hi>God</hi> will ſpue out of his mouth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.16. and even the beſt Chriſtians zeale at firſt does moſt commonly exceed their knowledge; but what I chiefly aime at, is, that we be not raſhly carried away by every breath of zeale, without examining whence it ſprings, and whereunto it tends.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>avoyding</hi> and <hi>withdrawing</hi> of our ſelves from ſuch as walke inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, <hi>and will not obey the word,</hi> is the laſt meanes, and utmoſt extent of power (except miraculous) which our Saviour left to his Apoſtles, and they unto the Church ſucceſſively for government of his people; if any take it to be too remiſſe or milde, doe not ſuch make themſelves wiſer then <hi>God,</hi> conceiving better of their owne fancies, then his Ordinances? tis no marvell, if they both ſeeme and prove ineffectuall to ſuch as have ſo little faith in them: is not this to diſtaſte <hi>Gods</hi> government, becauſe hee does not rule us with a rod of iron? full wanton are we that thus grow ſicke of <hi>His</hi> clemencie and gentleneſſe, importuning him farre more foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly then did the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that he would give them a <hi>King to reigne over them,</hi> although that <hi>Samuel</hi> by <hi>Gods</hi> expreſſe command imparted to them, how cruell and tyrannous a King would prove, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. yet the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> might be thought thus engaged as overſwayed with novelty, and a vehement deſire to be like other Nations, as not having had the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a Regall power themſelves, <hi>v.</hi> 20. But we who have ſo long to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and even ſo lately felt the Spirituall bondage of Epiſcopacie, which yet we are not freed from neither, are notwithſtanding not much unlike to people ſuddenly waked out of a deep ſleep by the hideous crying of fire, fire, whoſe eyes being dazled with the ſight thereof, and their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings furpriſed with the near approach, forth with caſt themſelves downe ſtaires, or out at window to their deſtruction, which in appearance might have beene prevented, had they been but throughly wakened and kept their wits about them: in like manner, we having beene ſo tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized over by the Biſhops, our conſciences enthralled by their Canons, and our perſons hunted up and downe, and baited by their Courts and Beagles in ſuch an intolerable manner: being quite tired out, are apt to thinke a bart exchange will eaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

what it was which enabled the Biſhops to torment us; conceiving we have now gained a full opportunity, are deſirous in all haſte to be enthral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led againe to any body, that will but for the preſent ſecure us from the firſt captivity.</p>
                  <p>Deare Countrymen and Brethren, let not me, though the meaneſt of you all, be thought preſumptuous, if with ſome importunity I beg of you, as you value the quiet and welfare of three Kingdomes, &amp; hope that other Nations may be from thence enlightned with purer and clearer beames of the moſt pretious Goſpel, to conſider only, whether if Biſhops had wanted a coercive power, they could poſſibly have prevailed ſo farre againſt the Saints and ſaving truths of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> whether the ſame ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty and power be not as effectuall (I forbeare to ſay farre more) to bring a people unto Popery, Turciſme or any other Religion except the right? and for ſuch as muſt be whipt into the faith, whether ſo many la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes more, will not eaſily whip them out againe? If this be ſo, as ſurely it cannot be denied by men of reaſon; why doe we not free our ſelves for ever, in ſtead of ſeeking eaſe only for the preſent? what meane we then to take this ſword or ſtaffe of Sovereignty from the hand of one Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan uſurper to put it into many? are not Presbyters men as well as Biſhops? are they not all ſubject to the ſame paſſions and infirmities? <hi>Act.</hi> 14.15. may not a power to puniſh and perſecute others tempt them as well as Biſhops, to ſatisfie their owne luſt and affections, and being many become a <hi>Hydra,</hi> a brotherhood of iniquity? may not they poſſibly erre as well as Biſhops, and being many prove more confident and obſtinate in impoſing ſuch errours upon ſubordinate Churches by force of their coercive juriſdiction? twas miraculous for <hi>Aarons</hi> rod to bud, but this which you put into the Presbyters hands, will naturally &amp; of its own diſpoſition ſprout out ſo faſt, and furniſh rods enough, as in ſtead of the exchangers which defiled the Temple, may quickly whip <hi>Gods</hi> beſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants out of Country: <hi>Corruptio optimi eſt peſſima:</hi> If a Presbytery grow tyrannicall, as by nature mankinde is prone to evill, they have more heads to manage it then Epiſcopacie, and ſo may become more formidable, more remedileſſe: If then <hi>God</hi> ſhall by any meanes reſtore us to ſuch a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wherein we may enjoy a liberty of conſcience to ſerve <hi>God</hi> according to his owne Ordinances, if we our ſelves deſire ſo to doe; let us not give or ſell our ſelves into ſuch ſlavery, as that it may be in the arme and power of others to ſay, you ſhall not ſerve God at all, or in any other manner then we approve of: proſcribe but this coercive power (which elſe will infalliby drive <hi>God</hi> from us, or us from his ſervice) in matters meerly of

Religion; and then you ſhall quickly ſee, men will not be ſo ambitous of <hi>Chriſts</hi> crowne of thornes; nor preſſe with ſo much carnall violence unto his Kingdome, and then being cleere of ſuch temptations as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate ſuiters of this <hi>Diana</hi> come laden with; we ſhall be better able to judge indifferently after what manner <hi>Chriſt</hi> would have his ſervants governed: Have not our prayers, petitions, and preparations, beene all for Reformation? has God ſuffered ſome hundred thouſands of men to be ſlaine, and three Kingdomes almoſt laid waſte, that thoſe which ſtill ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive might only have a breathing time, and then be ſubject to a harder bondage? ſurely <hi>God</hi> expects a larger improvement of ſo many talents, a better account of ſo great a truſt: Oh! let us not tempt God, nor fruſtrate the fulneſſe of his good intentions which he has ſo largely diſcovered to us, and ſtill proffers to put us in poſſeſſion, if we will but take hold there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; <hi>which the ſame God of his infinite mercie grant unto us, that we may doe ſo effectually, who are otherwiſe unlikely, and altogether unable to ſerve him as wee ought, or deliver our ſelve front our oppreſſors.</hi>

                  <p>But whereas we finde it ſaid in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> I have a few things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, <hi>becauſe thou ſuffereſt that woman Jezabel,</hi> which calleth herſelfe a Propheteſſe, to teach and ſeduce my ſervants, to commit fornication, and to eat things ſacrificed to <hi>Idols, Rev</hi> 2.20. It muſt be conſidered in what manner the Angel of the Church of <hi>Thyatira</hi> was ſaid to ſuffer it: for a man may well be ſaid to ſuffer any thing to be done that forbore to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid it, when a word of his mouth would have hindred it; this might have beene the Church of <hi>Thyatira's</hi> fault; or elſe perhaps the Angel did not informe and inſtruct the people better, nor admoniſh her to forbeare ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the weake Chriſtians with her ſpecious deluſions, and in ſeverall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſpects the Angel might be ſaid to ſuffer <hi>Jezabel,</hi> thereby becomming acceſſory and blameable: But it cannot be hence inferred, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel or Church of <hi>Thyatira</hi> had dominion over the peoples faith, or any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercive juriſdiction to take <hi>Jezabel</hi> and baniſh her, clap her up in priſon, and put her to death, for teaching the people contrary to the eſtabliſhed doctrine of that Church and place, this may not be underſtood to be the meaning, ſince tis alleadged by thoſe that ſtand for the coercive power, how the Angel could not have the approbation or aſſiſtance of it to this purpoſe; and beſides, ſuch a ſenſe or inference upon this text, would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it repugnant to divers others in the Scriptures, and appeare quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Preſidents and Precepts of our Bleſſed <hi>Savious</hi> and His <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in like manner all other places which are not fully cleered, or may, though probably, admit of divers interpretations, as <hi>Let every thing be done in order

                  <p>When <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> were threatned and forbid to ſpeak in the Name of Jeſus, they went and teported all that had paſled unto their own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, who thereupon betooke themſelves with one accord to <hi>God</hi> in prayer, acquainting him what great oppoſition the childe <hi>Jeſus</hi> found, and what they had further determined to doe in their owne hearts, deſiring <hi>God</hi> to ſtrengthen them with boldneſſe againſt their threatnings, that hee being pleaſed to ſtretch forth his hand, they might heale and doe great ſignes and wonders by the Name of his holy childe <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they were all filled with the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and they ſpake the Word of <hi>God</hi> with boldneſſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. from <hi>v.</hi> 23. to 31. ſince then we doe not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly finde this to be the Scripture courſe, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſtrengthen our ſelves in the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> not by the power of man, but do withall ſee the good ſucceſle upon it; what ground or colour can we have now adayes to proceed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe? I know 'twill be anſwered that miracles are ceaſed, and the Chriſtians in the Apoſtles times had no force of armes: I anſwer, that we finde <hi>v.</hi> 32. how the Beleevers were a multitude, and queſtionleſſe farre more then thoſe, that not very many monthes ſince went to <hi>Pauls</hi> Croſſe in the ſtrength of their numbers and imaginations (as is reported of ſome of them, otherwiſe the more they were the more commendable) and how can any make it appeare, that the not working miracles at preſent does not chiefly proceed from the obſtinate applying our ſelves to the arme of fleſh, and ſuch other inferiour meanes of our ownce inventions, or that cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the miraculous power is warrant ſufficient for Chriſtians to make uſe of the Civill Sword? But what wonder is it to ſee Powers and Armies imployed in oppoſing one an other? 'tis connaturall to carnall men to do ſo; and juſt with <hi>God</hi> in judgement to permit it ſhould be ſo: I ſay not this for incouragement of any to doe the like, for <hi>God</hi> will burne ſuch rods when he has done with them, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.7. but to diſſwade all others from giving the firſt occaſion, from tempting them unto a ſecond blow:
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:111953:45"/>
I am certaine it has often been ſaid, and Printed too, That the Biſhops en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to bring the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> unto a uniformity with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> was the ſpring head, and firſt beginning of all theſe Warres which have ſhed ſuch ſtreames of blood: <hi>Oh may the Preſbyters of Scotland take warning by it, leſt their attempting of the ſame,</hi> mutato nomine, <hi>in the ſelfe ſame manner prove cauſe and inſtruments to prolong the Wars; or may God for his infinite wiſdome and mercies ſake, bring ſo much more good and comfort out of this ſecond enterpriſe, as he did out of the firſt, unto all ſuch as deſire to worſhip him in Spirit and in truth, Joh.</hi> 4.24.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſayes, <hi>It muſt needs be that offences come, Mat.</hi> 18.7. and <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>There muſt be hereſies,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 11.19. But why thinke we muſt there be <hi>hereſies and offences? Paul</hi> gives the reaſon thereof in the ſame place, <hi>That they which are approved may be made manifeſt amongſt us:</hi> Now though <hi>murderers</hi> and <hi>adulteries</hi> come to paſſe by the ſame providence of God, yet not in the ſame manner, nor for the ſame end; for we doe not finde that <hi>God</hi> ever ſaid there muſt be <hi>murders</hi> or <hi>adulteries,</hi> and though they do come by the ſame permiſſion; yet it is no wayes ſaid that <hi>murders</hi> ſhould come for the <hi>manifeſtation of peaceable men,</hi> or <hi>adulteries</hi> for the <hi>juſtifying of chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> and laſtly, <hi>God</hi> appointed ſuch puniſhment for <hi>murder</hi> and <hi>adultery,</hi> as being put in execution, it both might and ought to have put all <hi>murderers and adulterers to death,</hi> for <hi>Gods</hi> will and pleaſure was there ſhould not any of them eſcape: But for <hi>Hereticks</hi> and other <hi>offenders in ſpirituall matters,</hi> ſince <hi>God</hi> has ſaid <hi>they muſt be,</hi> had he withall required the Church, or the Civill Magiſtrate to put them to death, the <hi>Bleſſed Spirit</hi> would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted it ſelfe; for how could they be and yet not be? how could they live for <hi>manifeſtation of the Saints,</hi> and yet be put to death by the Civill Sword, which poſſibly might have been ſo ſoone as they began to be He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks if the Civill Magiſtrate had but the power to doe it, and ſo they could not have lived ſufficiently to manifeſt thoſe which were approved.</p>
                  <p>Some perhaps will object; But if <hi>Hereticks</hi> and other <hi>ſpirituall offenders</hi> doe God ſuch good ſervice, how can he in juſtice puniſh them hereafter? or why is the <hi>Angel</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Thyatira</hi> blamed for <hi>ſuffering Jeza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel the Propheteſſe to ſeduce Gods people? Rev.</hi> 2.20. I anſwer, that though the <hi>Bleſſed Spirit</hi> ſaies <hi>there muſt be hereſies and offences;</hi> yet at ſame time it ſayes likewiſe, <hi>Woe to them by whom they come, Mat.</hi> 18 7. and good Chriſtians will not doubt the equity thereof if they reflect but upon the Scripture. Secondly, the <hi>Angel</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Thyatira</hi> was not bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for not putting <hi>Jezabel</hi> to a Civill death; for firſt, the <hi>Church</hi> had no ſuch Commiſſion from <hi>Chriſt:</hi> and ſecondly, it had no power from the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:111953:45"/>
Civill Magiſtrate to execute it: But as was ſaid before, the <hi>Church</hi> was juſtly taxed in that <hi>Jezabel</hi> was ſuffered to preach falſe doctrine incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolably without examining of the doctrine, and reproving her; in that they permitted her to ſeduce weake Chriſtians without cutting her off by the Sword of the Spirit, the power of excommunication: for <hi>God</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the <hi>Church</hi> to be as diligent in exerciſing their <hi>ſpirituall weapons,</hi> for convincing and <hi>compelling ſpiritually</hi> all Heretickes unto the truth; as he did that the Civill Magiſtrate ſhould have <hi>cut off every adulterer and murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer:</hi> only the difference is this, that ſince the meanes to be uſed againſt <hi>ſpirituall offenders</hi> being <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> ſuch as would not be willingly convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thereby, but obſtinately perſiſt, <hi>Gods</hi> pleaſure was, not that they were cut off by the Civill Sword as every murderer and adulterer, but that theſe ſhould ſurvive untill the <hi>day of judgement</hi> the end of their life, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.39. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 11.3. <hi>for the manifeſtation of thoſe</hi> which were approved, and we by putting them to a <hi>civill death,</hi> doe contradict this, and many other ſuch like <hi>Scriptures</hi> by endeavouring to render them of no effect.</p>
                  <p>But leſt any ſhould aske, Doth not <hi>God</hi> then as much deſire that <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> and all other <hi>ſpirituall offenders</hi> ſhould be convinced in demonſtration of the <hi>Spirit</hi> and reduced unto the truth, as that all murderers &amp; adulterers ſhould have beene put to death? if ſo, then one being to <hi>God</hi> as poſſible and eaſie as the other, it would follow, that all Hereticks might poſſibly be convinced, and none left <hi>for manifeſtation,</hi> as is pretended, <hi>of thoſe which are approved:</hi> I anſwer, that <hi>God</hi> expects the <hi>Church</hi> ſhould imploy all ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall meanes, and uſe as much diligence in convincing and reducing them to the truth, or elſe, if they perſiſt in cutting them off from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints which is the ſpirituall death; as he does that the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate</hi> ſhould put <hi>all murderers and adulterers unto a Civill death:</hi> and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the ſpirituall puniſhments prevaile only on ſuch as are ſpirituall, I mean, on ſuch as <hi>in times paſt were Hereticks like Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. but now are ripe unto converſion; ſo in conſequence, the obſtinate and perverſe, who <hi>ſtop their eares at the voice of the charmer, charm he never ſo well, Pſal.</hi> 58.5. neceſſarily perſiſting unconverted, are they which <hi>God</hi> will have ſtill to enjoy their Civill livelyhood <hi>for the manifeſting of thoſe which are approved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe it were Chriſtianity to put ſpirituall offenders to death; on what part of Scripture will we ground it, or whence can we deduce ſuch laws, but they will prove ridiculous, and be voydable by any heretick that ſcruples not to play the hypocrite, and pleads but as all delinquents doe at the Bar of Civill Juſtice in anſwering not guilty, and that whatever he was heretofore he is now converted?</p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:111953:46"/>
                  <p>The Lord ſayes, <hi>You ſhall take no ſatisfaction for the life of a murderer which is guilty of death, but he ſhall ſurely be put to death, Numb:</hi> 35.31. and it is juſt with <hi>God</hi> ſo to doe, to require this Civill death, though the murderer ſhould afterwards repent unfainedly, and be abſolved from eternall death, as the good thiefe whilſt be hung upon the croſſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.43. But if any one dye a Hereticke, a ſpirituall offender of ſo heynous a nature as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves eternall death, there remains no redemption; his Civill and Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all death are inſeparable concomitants, the former neceſſarily implies the latter, which is contrary to <hi>Pauls</hi> rule, who required only the <hi>deſtruction of the fleſh that the ſoule might be ſaved in the day of our Lord Jeſus</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5.</p>
                  <p>But as concerning meere Spirituall offenders (however you call them ſoule-murderers to ſcrue up their puniſhment above <hi>Gods</hi> commandment) at what time ſoever ſuch a ſinner repenteth him of his ſin, the <hi>Lord</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives him; and we are required to forgive him <hi>ſeventy times ſeven,</hi> even as often as he ſhall offend us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.22. But ſuppoſe a convinced Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke who going up the ladder cries out for mercy, and ſaies he is convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, can any Chriſtian Law deny him mercy, who is then no more a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticke then our ſelves? as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, <hi>Can any man forbid water that theſe Gentiles ſhould not be baptiſed, which have received the Holy Ghoſt as well as we? Act.</hi> 10.47. A murderer though he repent him of his fault, yet ſince it is impoſſible to reſtore the murdered to life againe, dyes a murderer though a penitent one; but he that is convinced and leaves his hereſie cannot be ſaid to dye a Hereticke; and being now no longer a Hereticke, what ground is there to put him to death or otherwiſe to puniſh him? this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended convert being thus got free, diſcovers himſelfe to be the ſame He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticke ſtill, untill he be apprehended and brought again to the Gallows, where he then pleads as hard for his ſecond converſion, or as often as the Civill Magiſtrate ſhall put him to it; and I know no reaſon but that his reprivall muſt be as often granted him if it were to dooms day. To ſay he plaies the hypocrite only to ſave his life, &amp; that he is not really converted: I anſwer, that he cannot then poſſibly be <hi>obſtinate,</hi> who both affirmes himſelfe not only to be <hi>willing,</hi> but ſaies alſo that he is <hi>really</hi> converted; and we may no more judge of his conſcience, who, for the preſent, both affirmeth to beleeve the ſame with us, and is conformable withall, then he may judge of ours. If you demand why a law may not as well be made for puniſhing Spirituall offenders though they ſhould have repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as well as murderers and adulterers: I anſwer, That ſuch a law would yet be more repugnant unto Scripture, which in expreſſe tearms requires.

Secondly, it would eyther make men indifferent, entertaining that which firſt they met withall, or elſe thoſe ſuch a one as beſt ſuted and agreed with their licentious diſpoſitions, and by degrees worke them to be quite Atheiſts, and of no Religion.

                  <p n="1">(1) THoſe many things which our Saviour and his Apoſtles afterwards could not impart unto the Primitive Chriſtians by reaſon of their weakneſſe, according to the rules of perſecution, muſt never be revealed, but remaine buried unto eternity; for ſuch as have this juriſdiction in their hands, make themſelves judges of whatſoever the Bleſſed Spirit ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal unto any of the Saints, whether he ſhall beleeve it &amp; inſtruct others therein or no, and being carnall, are not only ſubject to apprehend the greateſt truths of God to be unrighteouſnes, &amp;c. but even their very prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and grounds by which they are to exerciſe this dominion, tell them plainly, that unleſſe every further meaſure and degree of facred truth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the meridian of their Canons be a novelty, and conſequently here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, they cannot poſſibly be infallibly certaine how to diſcover any here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie at all, and leſſe then infallibility they abhorre to ſale by: But how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive ſuch poſitions are to the building up the myſticall Body of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:111953:49"/>
Chriſt: I humbly beſeech in all tenderneſſe of affection, that all which are of theſe opinions may ſeriouſly conſider, for the love they profeſſe unto the Head Chriſt Jeſus, how injurious they are unto him, withſtanding what in them lyes, the compleating of his glory, in filling up, and perfecting the number of the Saints which are His Body.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) <hi>God accepts a willing minde according to what a man hath, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what he hath not,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3) If we muſt not receive ſuch as differ from us to doubtfull diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, how much leſſe may we puniſh, or goe about to force them from what their different but weake faith leads them to? we muſt receive ſuch becauſe <hi>God</hi> has received them. <hi>The putting a difference between meats,</hi> the Apoſtle tearmes a weakneſſe of faith, no hereſie; ſo neither ought we to aggravate matters, but to mollifie and ſweeten all ſuch like differences with the ſame ſpirit of gentleneſſe and meekneſſe: as <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.6. <hi>He that eateth eateth to the Lord, and he that eateth not to the Lord he eateth not, becauſe</hi> whether eating or not eating, both of them give thanks to <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">(4) This example of <hi>Pauls</hi> were a ſufficient rule how to direct our ſelves in all occaſions towards men differing from us in opinion; his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe in this is both precept and warrant enough for us to doe the ſame: what then doe we ſcruple at, and why chooſe we rather to follow our owne inventions? erroneous tenets or opinions which deſtroy not the foundation, are but weakneſſes, <hi>Rom</hi> 14.1,2,3. let us then with <hi>Paul</hi> be weake with all ſuch, and we ſhall be certaine with <hi>Paul</hi> to ſave many of them, whom perſecution ſends headlong to deſtruction.</p>
                  <p n="5">(5) Such as perſecute cannot poſſibly live peaceably themſelves, or permit others to doe ſo, but reſiſt and oppoſe this parcell of holy Scripture as abſolutely and flatly as any can be oppoſed; for whereas we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, <hi>if it be poſſible to live peaceably with all men,</hi> we will not ſuffer others ſo much as a poſſibility of living peaceably amongſt us, unleſſe they will give way and enthrall their conſciences in a thouſand fold worſe bondage then that of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> by being ſubject to believe and live according to whatſoever we ſhall put upon them, and that to change and alter at our pleaſure.</p>
                  <p n="6">(6) 'Tis a mans owne faith that muſt ſave him, not an others; miſerable were we, if we muſt expect to be ſaved by the faith of others: we are commanded to <hi>make our owne calling and election ſure,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. and <hi>Paul</hi> would rather <hi>never eat meat whilſt the world ſtood then offend his brother,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>

we bring with us into this world; and unleſſe we get another, Chriſt will never take us for his Spouſe: <hi>They which are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God, Rom.</hi> 8.8. nay, <hi>'tis impoſſible to pleaſe him without faith, Heb.</hi> 11.6. and however <hi>God</hi> have ſecret paths, and unknown wayes whereby he directs infants to his glory that never did actually offend him, yet ſuch as hee brings to ripeneſſe of underſtanding, from them he expects a lively faith, by the <hi>righteouſneſſe whereof we muſt apprehend Chriſt and all his ſufferings, Phil.</hi> 3.9.12. and this is ſo neceſſary, that though it were poſſible for us to keepe the whole law of <hi>God,</hi> yet without this faith we can never ſee the face of <hi>God:</hi> originall ſinne which we derived from our father <hi>Adam,</hi> without faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> were abundantly ſufficient to condemne us; ſince then we are at the ſame time both borne and dead in ſinne; if ever we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſalvation, 'tis neceſſary we be regenerate through grace, and live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to repentance: But ſince <hi>Gods</hi> goodneſſe cannot be limited by an houre glaſſe, being pleaſed to call men differently at the 3,9, or any other hour, as he thought good to let us ſee by the Parable in the Goſpel, <hi>Mat.</hi>

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:111953:52"/>
Liberty ſaying, forbid him not, becauſe the miracle, how ill ſoever o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, was done in his name; a full argument that ſuch as are acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to have any one good gift, ought not to be ſilenced becauſe they want ſome others: But whereas we find our Saviour avouching in theſe words, Many will ſay to me in the laſt day, Lord, Lord, have we not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied in thy Name? and caſt out divells, and in thy Name done many wonderfull works? and <hi>then will I profeſſe unto them, I never knew you,</hi> depart from me ye that work iniquity, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.22,23. which being compared with <hi>Marke</hi> 9.38,39. it is moſt evident, that our <hi>Saviours</hi> pleaſure was that ſuch workers of falſe miracles, whom he intended to judge in the <hi>laſt</hi> day, ſhould not be hindered in the meane time by a coercive power; much leſſe ſuch as have knowne good gifts, and are acknowledged to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe them meerly for conſcience ſake: and in that our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſayes <hi>then,</hi> or <hi>in the laſt day will I profeſſe to know them not,</hi> it will eaſily follow that frail mankinde ſhould not be ſo confident of their ability to diſtinguiſh them before hand, much leſſe of having authority to prohibit them, in that Chriſt, from whom, in ſuch caſe, it muſt have been derived, gives licence, and commands them to imploy their talent.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) This preaching Chriſt <hi>not ſincerely, nor in truth,</hi> may well be meant not in reſpect of the manner only, but of the matter alſo, and in what kinde ſoever, it was done <hi>out of envy, ſtrife, contention, and on purpoſe to adde affliction unto Paul,</hi> yet he in ſtead of ſilencing or puniſhing the offenders, <hi>rejoyced thereat;</hi> ſo may we ſuppoſe a godly Miniſter, who is acknowledged to have eminent gifts, but withall infected with ſome one or other erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous opinion which deſtroyes not the foundation: would <hi>Paul</hi> thinke we have prohibited this godly man to preach Chriſt, becauſe that even whilſt he did preach Chriſt he ſometimes uſed to intermingle leaven of errour? his preaching Chriſt might ſave the ſoules of ſuch as heard him, whilſt his errour being mixt therewith, might make himſelfe a caſtaway, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3) This Scripture tells us of multiplicity of gifts which God diſtributes amongſt his ſervants, not, to ſome all, to ſome none at all; but to one he gives this gift, to an other that, with expreſſe advertiſement, that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of the Spirit, be it in how ſmall meaſure ſoever, is given to every man to profit withall, that is to profit and edifie others withall: now how can a weake ſervant of Chriſt, to who God has diſtributed any one porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Bleſſed Truth, imploy it to the honour of the Doner for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his people, if he ſhall be ſilenced or impriſoned by a ſuperiour po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, for wanting ſome other parcell of truth, or interweaving therewith
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:111953:52"/>
ſome erroneous doctrine, in the opinion of the Rulers where he lives? and how can they juſtifie this doing evill that good may come of it? the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terring a good gift together with a bad one? or how can they be ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that ſuch opinions are erroneous, when their Anceſtours perhaps declared them to be orthodox, and their ſucceſſours will have power to the ſame againe hereafter? whilſt other Nations and People, whom in other reſpects they acknowledge as wiſe and conſcientious as themſelves, doe hold the ſame at preſent? This is not alleadged to hinder any ſevere or pious inquiry after truth, the moſt eminent of all Gods gifts; or the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding faſt thereof when it is found; but to temper and qualifie the fierce zeale of ſuch who deny to others the ſame Chriſtian Liberty which they aſſume unto themſelves: Are we not all alike commanded to <hi>try the ſpirits?</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4 1. and is it not required of us all alike to <hi>buy the truth and fell it not? Prov.</hi> 23.23. to what purpoſe need I take paines to try the ſpirits my ſelfe, when I am certaine that my neighbour who is ſtronger then I, will impoſe his ſpirit, what ever it be, upon me? to what purpoſe ſhould I buy the truth? or how can I poſſibly hold faſt that which is good, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.21. when a mightier then my ſelfe pretends he may take it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way at pleaſure? but is it ſo? Doe we thinke the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> requires ſuch impoſſibilities? Is he become an <hi>Aegyptian</hi> taske-maſter, and as if he would purpoſely picke a quarrell and deſtroy us, require what lyes not in our power to performe? Oh far be from us all ſuch blaſphemy and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſſe, let <hi>God</hi> be juſt and every man a liar, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.4. Does he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us to prove all things and hold faſt the good? Does he command us to buy the truth and ſell it not? then certainly he intended we ſhould have meanes and power conducing thereunto; may ſuch therefore in their moſt retired thoughts conſider how heavy a doome betides them that hinder men in the ſearch of truth, or plunder them of it, when they have found it: And ſince he that refuſing to imploy his <hi>one</hi> talent, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now if <hi>Peter</hi> could not withſtand <hi>God</hi> in his ſervants which had but the like, or more inferiour gifts to himſelfe; how unwarrantable is it for us that come ſhort of <hi>Peters</hi> ſpirit to oppoſe our brethren, who perhaps have yet more excellent endowments then our ſelves? and how can they judge them to be otherwiſe, ſince ſuch only as are Spiritually minded can judge of Spirituall gifts? and ſuch as are leſſe Spirituall have not a capacity to judge of thoſe which are more Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. but if an <hi>Angel</hi> or the <hi>Bleſſed Spirit</hi> hath revealed any further truth unto a brother, <hi>Act.</hi> 23.9.

                  <p n="4">(4) Here we ſee one teaching publikely, who yet himſelfe had need, and was afterwards farther and more perfectly inſtructed by a man and woman, whom yet we doe not finde to have had any extraordinary or miraculous gifts: and the <hi>Centurion</hi> who though he had committed Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry in falling downe at <hi>Peters</hi> feet, and worſhipping him (but ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) with divine worſhip; yet through <hi>Gods</hi> infinite mercy, and pardoning him as is preſumed, he ſuddenly thereupon received the <hi>Holy Ghoſt, Act.</hi> 10.25.26.44.</p>
                  <p n="5">(5) Theſe were twelve proſelite <hi>Gentiles</hi> Diſciples and good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans who yet profeſſed themſelves not to have heard whether there were a third Perſon in <hi>Trinity;</hi> and ſo doubtleſſe many a godly Saint may live and dye, into whoſe thoughts never entred one of hundreds of tenets and points in Chriſtianity, which when once ſtarted, certaine Spirits are ſo carneſt after, as by and by, in all poſt haſte and ſpeed they make the ſtudy and knowledge of them neceſſary to ſalvation, when yet they might for the moſt part, as well have laine ſtill in ſilence; ſince controverſies doe chiefly make breaches upon the bond of love, diſturbing the practiſe of

But you'l ſay perhaps, that Papiſts or other hereticks cannot juſtly pretend to have proffered the truth in ſuch a way as might infallibly convince all ſuch as were not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, but willing to receive it; becauſe they cannot tender that truth to others which they themſelves have not: I anſwer, that this is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to beare ſway with Papiſts, no more then when Papiſts alleadge the like to Proteſtants: If it be lawfull for any People or Religion to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute or keep Inquiſition houſes, alleading the truth hath been ſufficiently held out unto them, 'tis lawfull to all alike; neither can any one word be ſpoken which in the judgement of rationall indifferent men ſuch as are not concerned in the quarrell, but will decide the controverſie indifferent, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be let alone, or practiſed by both alike, and ſo it muſt remaine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the great day of judgement, as not being to be determined by any leſſe Oracle then of <hi>God</hi> himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe you had tendred the Goſpel in a powerfull and all-ſufficient way of convincing all ſuch as were not perverſe, and could likewiſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh who were thus malignantly obſtinate, ſinning againſt their own conſciences as you alleadge; if <hi>God</hi> be pleaſed to let ſuch ſtill ſurvive, who beſides the hangman, ſuch as are authoriſed thereunto, may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being guilty of their bloud, put malefactours to death at any time, much leſſe before the time? before the ſentence be decreed or publiſhed by <hi>God</hi> the higheſt Judge? but me thinks I ſee it ſtill more clear, that though ſuch wilfull heretickes could eaſily be diſtinguiſhed, yet it is <hi>Gods</hi> will and pleaſure they ſhould be permitted to live out the dayes which he has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them to repent in, or aggravate their ſin; and I beſeech the Chriſtian Reader in all tenderneſſe of affection, impartially to joyne with me in the triall of it.</p>

                  <p>Againe, the Lord declares himſelfe about the time: He will not have theſe <hi>tares</hi> the <hi>children of the wicked one,</hi> the <hi>Hereticks</hi> pull'd up ſo long as the World laſts, that their life; but that the time for pulling them up ſhall be the <hi>harveſt,</hi> the end of the World, <hi>v.</hi> 39.

no; and that the <hi>Angels</hi> were likelier to know Hereticks then the very Saints on earth; and yet theſe <hi>Angles</hi> muſt not goe to rooting up the <hi>tares</hi> untill the day of judgement; but the uſe of the <hi>Parable</hi> lyes not ſo much in applying the prohibition unto the <hi>true</hi> Church for not rooting up the <hi>tares;</hi> but rather unto a <hi>falſe</hi> erroneous Church, that ſuch might bee with-held from rooting (though every Church ſo far forth as it perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth others is falſe) for if God had given leave unto the <hi>true</hi> Church to pull up the <hi>tares,</hi> each <hi>falſe</hi> Church pretending to be the only true one, would have appropriated the commiſſion to her ſelfe, and ſo have gone to worke pulling up more <hi>wheat</hi> the <hi>tares.</hi>

                     <hi>Obſervations upon</hi> CHAP. XV.</head>
                  <p>I Know there are many, who altogether ſlight the teſtimonies of theſe Unbeleevers, as if there were no weight in them at all, nor no more to be reflected on, than the fondeſt fancies of their idolizing imaginations: but we ſhall finde them in a higher degree regardable, if wee conſider; 1. That they were all ſpoken in favour of the Goſpel: 2. That being Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleevers, they could not be induced thereunto for conſcience ſake, as if they had been in love with Chriſtianity, but meerly conſtrained by force and evidence of reaſon, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes of them upon another occaſion; that though they had not the Law, they did by nature the things contayned in the Law, and ſo not having the Law, are not withſtanding a Law unto themſelves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14.3. That <hi>God</hi> proſpered each of theſe inſtruments and made them ſucceſſefull to preſerving of the Apoſtles perſons and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of the truth: for we find that the <hi>Jewes</hi> were ſo convinced with <hi>Gamaliels</hi> arguments, that they all agreed in ſtead of killing, to beate the Apoſtles only: and ſo being let goe, <hi>they taught dayly in the Temple, not ceaſing to preach Chriſt Ieſus, and the number of the Diſciples were multiplied, Act.</hi> 5.41.42. <hi>c.</hi> 6.1. By meanes of the Phariſees party that ſided for <hi>Paul</hi> againſt the Sadduces, the chiefe Captaine with his ſoldiers, gayned oppottunity to releeve and bring him into the Caſtle; thence was he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed for <hi>Ceſarea,</hi> and ſo for <hi>Rome,</hi> where he lived two whole yeeres in his owne bired houſe, <hi>receiving all that came unto him, and teaching thoſe things which concerned the Lord leſus, with all confidence, no man forbidding him, Act.</hi> 28.30.31. which how effectually it wrought, appeares by that
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:111953:60"/>
teſtim ony whieh the Spirit of God by <hi>Paul</hi> gave of them, that <hi>their faith was spoken of throughout the whole world, Rom.</hi> 1.8. And laſtly, by the event of what is come to paſſe, we may cleerely ſee the wiſe providence of God in ſo diſpoſing, together with his approbation of what ſucceeded.</p>
                  <p>If then theſe Unbeleeyers, by the <hi>law of Nature,</hi> did the things contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the <hi>law of Moſes;</hi> how will they condemne us in the day of jadge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who having had the advantage of both Tables, and beene ſo long inſtructed in the Schooles both of the Prophets and Apoſtles, doe yet walke point tlanke, as if wee were deſperately hardned againſt the Law of Nature, and ſtrength of reaſon? The <hi>Iewes</hi> being ſwolne big with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie, and enraged to the higheſt reſolutions of putting the Apoſtles to death for conſcience ſake, for obeying GOD rather then man, <hi>Gamaliel a ſtranger to the promiſes of grace, without God in the world, Epheſ.</hi> 2.12. cries out, Ye men of Iſrael, Suſpend a little: looke about you: <hi>take heed what you doe: engage not your ſelves in a poſſibility of fighting againſt the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> The Scribes that were on the Phariſees ſide, perceiving that <hi>Paul</hi> was a Phariſee as touching the Reſurrection, <hi>Act.</hi> 23.6.9. that they might reſcue him from the fury of the Sadduces, profeſſe, ſaying, <hi>We find no fault in Paul, but if a spirit or an Angel hath ſpoken to him,</hi> we may not, we cannot, <hi>let us not ſet our ſelves to ſight againſt God.</hi> Canthere be any thing more full of truth than either of theſe ſayings? Hath not the bleſſed <hi>Spirit</hi> record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them for ſuch in ſacred Writ? Doe they not exactly quadrate with common ſenſe and reaſon? Will not ſo ample a truth in the mouth even of theſe unbeleeving witneſſes, condemn us Chriſtians, whom <hi>Paul</hi> may tell unto our ſhame, that <hi>there is not a Wiſe man amongst us, not one able to judge betweene his brethren,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6. But Chriſtian perſecuteth Chriſtian, and that not barely to the ſcandall of unbeleevers, but to the keeping them from ever comming to the knowledge of the truth. <hi>Paul</hi> is accuſed of the <hi>Iewes</hi> for <hi>teaching to wor ſhip God contrary to Law: Gallio</hi> the Deputy of <hi>Achaia,</hi> tells them he thought it no <hi>wrong to any man, or wicked lewdneſſe, which in ſuch caſe he would have judged and done reaſon,</hi> but being rather <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of words or names,</hi> ſome difference in their religion (wherin he thought men might have as much liberty to differ, and no more ſubject their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences to the commands of others, than if it were onely for matter of words or names) he refuſed to be judge thereof, and <hi>drove them from the judgement ſeat. More than forty men made a vow not to eat or drinke till they had killed Paul, Act.</hi> 23.13.14. bu <hi>Claudius Lyſias</hi> reſcues him, <hi>v.</hi> 27. The multtude both at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> and <hi>Ceſarea,</hi> exclaime againſt <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaying, <hi>he deſerved to die,</hi> and dealt with <hi>Feſtus</hi> how they might compaſſe it: yet hee

teſtifies that <hi>Paul had committed nothing worthy of death, Act.</hi> 25.24.25. And to ſumme up all his charge, though <hi>Paul</hi> was accuſed as <hi>a hereticke, an Idolater, teaching to worſhip God contrary to Law, and a mover of ſedition,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was well knowne, that the preaching <hi>Ieſus,</hi> the differing from the <hi>Iewes</hi> in Religion, was the only reaſon which incenſed them ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, both <hi>Gallio, Claudius Lyſias, Feſtus,</hi> and King <hi>Agrippa,</hi> all Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleevers, atteſt they finde no matter of death in <hi>Paul,</hi> but that hee might enjoy his liberty, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.32.</p>

But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all thoſe againſt whom we vent our ſpleene and malice, it may appear that ſuch as had offended only in tenderneſſe of conſcience, have had the greateſt ſhare: If we will but call to minde the ſtories we have heard, the examples wee have ſeene, and what we have been conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to our ſelves; we ſhall eaſily finde that no offenders of any ſort ſoever have felt more harſh proceedings in the whole managing of their arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then ſuch as ſuffered for conſcience ſake; ſuch muſt be kept cloſe priſoners in very dungeons, denied the viſitings of their wives and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; whilſt others for gaining opportunity to ſee them only, were brought within the compaſſe of being puniſhed. Thoſe unbeleeving <hi>Romans,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of the <hi>Bereans</hi> upon another occaſion, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.10,11. were far more noble, more juſt, may I not ſay more Chriſtian-like? <hi>

                  <p>But it were better, and a far ſafer way in being too remiſſe than but a little over ſevere, eſpecially having to do with ſuch, who, however abject in the eyes of men, may poſſibly be deare to <hi>God, like the apple of his eye, Zach.</hi> 2.8. <hi>whom</hi> for any one to <hi>offend, is worſe then to have a milſtone hung a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his necke, and caſt into the ſea, Matth.</hi> 18.6. and however the world revile them for the preſent, they are <hi>they that ſhall judge the world hereafter,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 6.2. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Romans,</hi> that <hi>ſalvation was come unto the Gentiles to provoke the Jewes to jealouſie, Rom.</hi> 11.11. as though <hi>God</hi> uſed that as a meanes to winne the <hi>Jewes</hi> againe into his ſheepfold; as though <hi>Paul</hi> thought ſuch an argument a moſt prevalent motive to regaine them: Deare Brethren, I beſeech you let not us give the Saints of <hi>God</hi> to ſee, there is leſſe hopes of us than of the <hi>Jewes;</hi> let us by theſe favours which <hi>God</hi> in his providence, ſtirr'd up thoſe unbeleeving <hi>Gentiles</hi> to expreſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Goſpels cauſe, provoke us to treat all Chriſtians more mercifully hereafter, not forgetting that our <hi>Saviour</hi> requires us to <hi>be mercifull as our heavenly Father is mercifull, Luke</hi> 6.36. &amp; if any one ſhall ſay it is impoſſible to be mercifull as our heavenly Father is mercifull, and ſo grow regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe of this command of our <hi>Saviours,</hi> like the ſlothfull ſervant who having received one talent, and being to give an account thereof, ſaid, <hi>Lord, I know that thou art an hard man reaping where thou haſt not ſowne, and gathering where thou haſt not ſtrawed, and I was afraid and went and hid thy talent in the earth, loe, there thou haſt that is thine: His Lord anſwered and ſaid unto him, thou wicked and ſlothfull ſervant, thou kneweſt that I reap where I ſowed not, and gather where I have not ſtrawed, thou oughteſt therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my comming I ſhould have received mine owne with uſury; take therefore the talent away from him, and caſt the unprofitable ſervant into utter darkneſſe, Matth.</hi> 25.24,25,26,27,28,30. In like manner, if it ſeem hard that it ſhould be required of us to be mercifull as our heavenly Father is mercifull, we have ſo much more reaſon to ſtrive all we can, and preſſe towards it with all might &amp; main, not queſtioning how poſſible it is to be ſo, leſt we be checkt with <hi>Sarah, Gen.</hi> 18.15. or ſtruck dumb with <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias,</hi> for not beleeving, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.20. many things are impoſſible to men, but nothing is impoſſible to <hi>God, Marke</hi> 10.27. wherefore when <hi>God</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires any thing of us, our beſt way is, as <hi>Paul</hi> did when he was cal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>French</hi> King told his Holineſſe (forſooth) that for his part, he onely endeavoured as a faithfull ſhepheard, underſtanding that his ſheep might be endangered through the multiplying of unmercifull wolves, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide himſelfe of maſtive dogs to reſcue them: and the <hi>Venetians</hi> have of a long time, by the ſame ſtratagem, not only preſerved themſelves, but all <hi>Italy</hi> beſides in likelihood, from the inundation of the <hi>Papalines:</hi> yet this was in their owne defence againſt powerfull adverſaries when they had no ſafety neerer hand: But for a Proteſtant Church government to require or countenance the Civill Magiſtrate (and whether it be Chriſtian or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it varies not the caſe) againſt a private perſon or an other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant congregation, which neither doth, nor can offend their Civill peace, much leſſe their Spirituall, the beſt part whereof ſhould be in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out of reach, is ſo far from countenancing in Scripture, ſo contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie to reaſon, and deſtructive to its ſelfe, as that for wiſe and conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious men to be tranſported thereunto, makes me more wonder, then at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other erroneous tenet whatſoever: But praiſed be for ever <hi>Gods</hi> infinite goodneſſe in ſubduing daily ſo many to this truth, the contrary whereof hath ſo long together with-held the Goſpel of truth in miſerable captivity and invincible ignorance.</p>
                  <p>But to returne againe unto Church fellowſhip and covenant: I would very faine know, whether ſuch a Covenant as before was mentioned, doth not oblige us to the ſame which we call Canonicall obedience, and doe ſo much, ſo juſtly upbraid the Papacie and Epiſcopacie withall? nay, is it not yet worſe then the vow of ſingle life wherein all <hi>Nunnes</hi> and <hi>Fryers</hi> intrap themſelves? for they doe not runne ſo great a hazard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tainted with bodily pollutions, as ſuch Church covenanters do in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ſpirituall: nay, they, when they enter into that vow, are certaine for the preſent of being in the moſt deſirable condition of life according to <hi>Pauls</hi> judgement, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.38. and as certain that they ſhall ever do beſt to continue in it: which infallibility of certainty no man can poſſibly have in reſpect of his Church fellowſhip and condition: but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, theſe Church covenanters acknowledge to want light, and profeſſe

to ſeeke it that they may be better enabled to ſerve <hi>God</hi> as they ought, <hi>non progredi eſt regredi,</hi> and that it is required of them to grow in grace and godlineſſe from one degree and meaſure thereof unto another; which; who ſo enters into ſuch fellowſhip, may not doe, much leſſe make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of, unleſſe the major part of the ſame congregation approve and joyn with him therein. I have oftentimes known it objected unto ſuch as were engaged for Celebrate, what it was ſhould make them ſo precipitous in vowing to live all their life time ſingly &amp; chaſtely, when they themſelves acknowledged they could not poſſibly know ſo long before hand, how wel they ſhould be diſpoſed twenty yeares after to the performance of it, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it did not little trouble them to ſatisfie this querie; for though they conceive it abſolutely as much in their owne power to live ſingly as ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, yet they acknowledge a far greater temptation in the former then in the latter; but being tranſported with the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie <note n="*" place="margin">
